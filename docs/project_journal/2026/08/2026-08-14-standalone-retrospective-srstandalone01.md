# Standalone Session Retrospective Repository

## Summary

- Created `Joey-Tools/codex-session-retrospective` as the canonical source
  repository for the complete Retrospective skill.
- Migrated the v1 comparison helper, modular v2 engine, closed CLI and schemas,
  references, agent metadata, fixtures, and Retrospective-specific tests from
  the closed `codex-workflow-hygiene` PRs #67 and #69.
- Adopted a singleton-skill layout with `SKILL.md`, `agents/`, `references/`,
  and `scripts/` at the repository root.

## Current State

- The standalone repository and task-scoped `wip/standalone-retrospective`
  branch exist.
- Signed migration commit `fad88a480f40061424191fafea7d4b0b1f932da0`
  preserves the standalone source snapshot before the first local review.
- Catalog schema v3 and transport manifest v2 bind a closed
  `session_identity` witness independently of the mutable source label.
- Session identity now derives from the same domain-separated selector
  commitment in Session, Daily, Weekly, and Baseline modes. Session acceptance
  re-derives that source reference from the authenticated witness and rejects
  relabeling of non-target, unresolved, or exact-target evidence into another
  accounting class.
- Private sync, installed release changes, workspace registry changes, and the
  legacy deletion PR are intentionally out of scope until this repository is
  complete.

## Validation

- Python 3.13 v2 engine tests: 632 passed.
- Python 3.13 v1, CLI, skill, and CI contract tests: 937 passed.
- Focused source-identity and module-boundary tests: 22 passed after formatting.
- Ruff 0.13.2 lint passed for `scripts/` and `tests/`; edited Python files pass
  the formatter check without mechanically rewriting inherited migration-only
  sources.
- Both GitHub Actions workflows pass `actionlint`.
- The installed OpenAI skill validator passes through an isolated Python 3.13
  environment with PyYAML.
- Python 3.13 full repository discovery: 1,569 passed in 2,605.189 seconds.
- Exact-secret admission for `a3836660..fad88a48` was clean with complete
  temporary cleanup.
- A fresh-context Codex review of `a3836660..fad88a48` found three issues: a
  cross-mode Session identity split, an ambiguous-witness state-table hole,
  and exact-tuple matching that could miss target gap variants. The follow-up
  centralizes commitment-derived Session references, uses an explicit closed
  three-state policy, and rejects forbidden target reasons independently of
  stage metadata.
- Reviewer-fix focused tests pass 8/8; identity, CLI, and module-boundary tests
  pass 104/104; full source-transport and orchestrator tests pass 207/207.
- The first reviewer-fix Python 3.13 full repository discovery passes
  1,572/1,572 in 2,686.649
  seconds. Ruff 0.13.2, both workflow files under `actionlint`, the OpenAI
  skill validator, the project-journal validator, and `git diff --check` also
  pass on the reviewer-fix tree.
- A second fresh-context Codex review of `a3836660..e50d6466` found two
  retained-history Git gaps: post-admission commands could rediscover mutable
  `.git` control files, and a later shallow boundary was not revalidated.
- The follow-up binds `.git`, `commondir`, and `gitdir` identity and content,
  enters the held common-dir descriptor before every post-admission Git
  command, verifies the relative git-dir and object store, and runs the closed
  object/ref command set with explicit bare metadata paths and a fixed
  discovery ceiling. Shallow history is an exact forbidden-metadata absence
  checked before and after every command.
- Six focused discovery, linked-worktree, shallow-drift, path-replacement, and
  ABA regressions pass. The complete publication transaction module passes
  91/91 in 2,470.280 seconds; the engine boundary suite passes 19/19 after its
  exact branch-proxy fixture is updated from 8,520 to 8,568.
- Final Python 3.13 full repository discovery passes 1,575/1,575 in 2,675.201
  seconds on the Git discovery and shallow-revalidation implementation tree.
- The next fresh-context Codex review of `a3836660..322fe97b` found that the
  publisher sign/verify canary inherited the complete host environment even
  though its GPG executable bytes were bound. That exposed the production
  `GNUPGHOME` to dynamic-loader, Python, shell, Git, and agent injection
  variables outside the executable-authority contract.
- The canary now reuses the publication layer's strict subprocess environment,
  adds only the dedicated `GNUPGHOME`, and keeps the fixed locale, `PATH`, and
  timezone contract. A real fake-GPG regression captures both sign and verify
  process environments and proves that poisoned host variables are absent.
- The canary-focused suite passes 5/5, the affected orchestrator suite passes
  111/111 in 194.853 seconds, and the module-boundary suite passes 19/19.
  Final Python 3.13 repository discovery passes 1,576/1,576 in 2,839.720
  seconds on the closed-environment implementation tree.
- A direct default-host canary probe is non-counting: executable authority
  rejected the ambient Homebrew GPG before keyring access because its `Cellar`
  ancestor is group-writable. This is the intended deployment boundary; the
  publication caller must supply a GPG executable under an admitted private
  path. The authorized disposable-GPG publication fixture is covered by the
  successful full discovery.
- The next fresh-context Codex review of `a3836660..add6f4a` found two further
  launch-boundary gaps: the public coordinator documentation and native action
  used Python without the complete isolation flags, and canary cleanup could
  reap its leader while leaving a same-group descendant alive.
- The public coordinator now requires `python3 -I -B -S` in the skill,
  operator reference, README, automation cutover records, native coordinator
  actions, and its direct-entry startup guard. Runtime regressions prove that
  missing flags fail closed and that poisoned `PYTHONPATH`, `sitecustomize`,
  and current-directory modules do not execute.
- Canary supervision retains the launch PGID before leader reaping, kills the
  complete group on every terminal path, reaps the leader, and waits for exact
  group absence. Darwin `EPERM` from a killed orphan zombie remains unproven
  and is polled until `ESRCH`; persistent `EPERM` still fails closed. Real
  closed-pipe success and inherited-pipe timeout descendants are both covered.
- Canary-focused tests pass 7/7; focused CLI/skill tests pass 11/11; module
  boundaries pass 19/19 with the CLI's 1,950-line cap unchanged and the exact
  branch proxy updated from 8,568 to 8,591. The complete affected authority,
  projection, CLI, transport, orchestrator, and skill matrix passes 292/292 in
  294.832 seconds.
- Final Python 3.13 repository discovery passes 1,582/1,582 in 2,833.264
  seconds on the isolated-launch and complete process-group cleanup tree.

## Acceptance

- Python 3.13 focused and full repository tests pass.
- Source/session classification is receipt-bound and cannot silently discard
  the exact Session target.
- The skill and CLI contracts use the standalone root layout.
- Exact-secret admission, the required local Codex processor, hosted CI, and
  current-head GitHub Codex evidence pass for the final PR head.
- The signed source PR merges without changing any private sync repository.
